Purpose:

A Drupal module (and eventually independant webapp) that leverages the CiviCRM API v3 to provide a small but very effective mobile interface to your CiviCRM installation.

Tentative feature scope of version 1 - kerouac: to be released for CiviCON
- being able to login
- being able to search for a contact,
- display contact details (email, address, phone)
- being able to log a meeting (activity)
- being able to add a contact (name, organisation, email, phone)


TODO:

- they are 40 types of entity available on the API, quite a few features to add ;)
Beside that, things like canvassing or updating the status of participants (registered -> attended) seems to be some of the features that would benefit most a mobile interface.
